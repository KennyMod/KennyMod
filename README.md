### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Kenny Modebelu
#### I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer

I'm Kenny from South Africa and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Being a full-stack engineer, allows me to develop not only client-facing apps and websites but also to develop them with cutting-edge back-end support.

My area of expertise is focused on building robust front-ends and back-ends that do all the heavy lifting for your app or website. I love to create systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized, and beautiful yet effective.
