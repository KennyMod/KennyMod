I'm Kenny from South Africa and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Being a full-stack engineer, allows me to develop not only client-facing apps and websites but also to develop them with cutting-edge back-end support.

My area of expertise is focused on building robust front-ends and back-ends that do all the heavy lifting for your app or website. I love to create systems that are light yet powerful, distributed yet synchronized, and beautiful yet effective.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML5 / CSS3 / Bootstrap / MongoDB / Node.js / Arduino / Express.js

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
